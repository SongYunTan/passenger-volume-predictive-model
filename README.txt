This is a README for REP Team 6's DSAI Project submission.
This project is done by Perlyn Chew, Tan Song Yun, and Justin Yip.

All of our code (including downloading the dynamic dataset and pip install) are in the Jupyter notebook REP_Team06.ipynb

Both the pdf and ppt version of our slides are also included in this folder. 

Our problem is to predict the total bus volume (tap-in and tap-out) in a Subzone.

Datasets used include dynamic bus volume data (tap-in and tap-out), dynamic bus stop data, and static train station data from LTA.

Resident Count and Subzone demarcation was obtained from data.gov.

Relevant datasets are not included in this folder as instructed, hence, please do not run the code. 

Thank you!
